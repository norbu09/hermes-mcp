# Hermes MCP Server Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of implementing the server-side component architecture for Hermes MCP. It provides a summary of completed work and upcoming tasks.

## Current Status

As of 2025-05-22, we have completed the following phases:

### Phase 1: Core Server Implementation ✅

We have successfully implemented the core behaviors and server components:

- ✅ Defined core behaviors (`Tool`, `Resource`, `Prompt`)
- ✅ Implemented attribute parsing for metadata extraction
- ✅ Created server GenServer with supervision
- ✅ Implemented basic message handling

### Phase 2: Transport Layers ✅

We have successfully implemented all transport layers:

- ✅ Implemented STDIO transport for local process communication
- ✅ Implemented HTTP/SSE transport for web-based communication
- ✅ Implemented Streamable HTTP transport for the latest MCP specification

The Streamable HTTP implementation supports:
- Initial request/response for server initialization
- Streaming responses for tool execution
- Proper content negotiation with application/x-ndjson
- Chunked transfer encoding
- Progress updates during tool execution

### Phase 3: Phoenix Integration ✅

We have successfully implemented the Phoenix integration components:

- ✅ Created Phoenix controller for HTTP endpoints
- ✅ Implemented router macros for MCP endpoints
- ✅ Created authentication plugs

The Phoenix integration provides:
- Easy integration with Phoenix applications
- Support for both regular and streaming endpoints
- Authentication support with customizable handlers
- Comprehensive examples for implementation

## Next Steps

## Upcoming Phases

After Phase 3, we will proceed with:

### Phase 4: Component Discovery and Registration

1. Implement module discovery based on module attributes
2. Create registry for component registration
3. Implement dynamic component loading

### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation

1. Create comprehensive test suite
2. Write detailed documentation
3. Create example implementations
