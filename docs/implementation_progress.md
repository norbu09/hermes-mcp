# Hermes MCP Server Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of implementing the server-side component architecture for Hermes MCP. It provides a summary of completed work and upcoming tasks.

## Current Status

As of 2025-05-22, we have completed the following phases:

### Phase 1: Core Server Implementation ✅

We have successfully implemented the core behaviors and server components:

- ✅ Defined core behaviors (`Tool`, `Resource`, `Prompt`)
- ✅ Implemented attribute parsing for metadata extraction
- ✅ Created server GenServer with supervision
- ✅ Implemented basic message handling

### Phase 2: Transport Layers ✅

We have successfully implemented all transport layers:

- ✅ Implemented STDIO transport for local process communication
- ✅ Implemented HTTP/SSE transport for web-based communication
- ✅ Implemented Streamable HTTP transport for the latest MCP specification

The Streamable HTTP implementation supports:
- Initial request/response for server initialization
- Streaming responses for tool execution
- Proper content negotiation with application/x-ndjson
- Chunked transfer encoding
- Progress updates during tool execution

### Phase 3: Phoenix Integration ✅

We have successfully implemented the Phoenix integration components:

- ✅ Created Phoenix controller for HTTP endpoints
- ✅ Implemented router macros for MCP endpoints
- ✅ Created authentication plugs

The Phoenix integration provides:
- Easy integration with Phoenix applications
- Support for both regular and streaming endpoints
- Authentication support with customizable handlers
- Comprehensive examples for implementation

### Phase 4: Component Discovery and Registration ✅

We have successfully implemented component discovery and registration:

- ✅ Implemented the `AttributeParser` module to extract MCP metadata from module attributes
- ✅ Created the `Registry` module for dynamic component registration and discovery
- ✅ Updated the server module to integrate with the registry
- ✅ Enhanced the supervisor to include the registry in the supervision tree

The component discovery system provides:
- Support for both behavior-based and attribute-based components
- Dynamic discovery of components at runtime
- Automatic registration of components in the registry
- Efficient lookup of components by name or type

### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation ✅

We have successfully implemented testing and documentation:

- ✅ Created comprehensive test suites for all modules
- ✅ Added detailed documentation for all components
- ✅ Created example implementations to demonstrate usage

The testing and documentation includes:
- Unit tests for all core modules and behaviors
- Integration tests for Phoenix components
- Tests for streaming functionality
- Comprehensive examples in the `Hermes.Examples.HermesMCPExamples` module
- Detailed documentation for all public APIs

## Next Steps

All planned phases of the Hermes MCP server implementation have been completed. The server is now ready for use in production applications.

Potential future enhancements could include:

1. **Additional Transport Layers**: Support for WebSockets, gRPC, or other protocols
2. **Enhanced Security**: More advanced authentication and authorization mechanisms
3. **Performance Optimizations**: Benchmarking and optimizing for high-throughput scenarios
4. **Client Libraries**: Creating client libraries for common languages and frameworks
5. **Example Applications**: Building example applications that demonstrate real-world usage
